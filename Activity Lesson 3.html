<br>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>The children were hungry. They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She</p>
<P style=font-family:bahnschrift;>walked into the house. The children ran over to her. “Mama, we’re so hungry,” they both</p>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>said. </p>
<br>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup.</p>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>She poured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made</p>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was hot.</p>
<br>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on</p>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. “Thank</p>
<p style=font-family:bahnschrift;>you, mommy!” they said. Then they started eating. The cat and the dog watched them eat.</p>
